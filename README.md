[update: site is broken because heroku is no longer free]
have you ever thought "gee, i wish there was a way i could read all the daily comic strips i want in one place and not have to visit websites, it's kind of killing the vibe because it's so much work"?, well, think no more, after a year of doing nothing about it and ~2 weeks of thinking about it and ~2 days of actually doing it, i give you all, a new year's gift, https://armadillo-comic-scraper.herokuapp.com/
